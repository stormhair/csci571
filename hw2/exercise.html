<I><B>Exercise 1</B></I>is to imitate a page. The screen shot of the page is given. What I did was to build a page that is completely the same as the page in the image. Images were forbidden to use. All I used are CSS ans HTML. And I didn't use any professional page editors such as Dreamweaver more than a text editor.
