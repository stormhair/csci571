		<h1>Description</h1>
		<p><em>Homework 2</em> is this page!</p>
		<P>
			<em>Homework 3</em> is to imitate a page. The screen shot of the page is given. What I did was to build a page that is completely the same as the page in the image. Images were forbidden to use. All I used are CSS and HTML. And I didn't use any professional page editors such as Dreamweaver more than a text editor.

		<p><em>Homework 4</em>: I am busy with it right now...</p>
